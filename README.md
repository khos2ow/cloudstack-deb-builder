Docker images for building Apache CloudStack DEB packages.

This will give portable, immutable and reproducable mechanism to build packages for releases. A very good candidate to be used by the Jenkins slaves of the project.

## Build DEB packages

Building DEB packages with the Docker container is rather easy, a few steps are required:

### Pull Docker images

Let's assume we want to build packages for Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial). We pull that image first:

    docker pull khos2ow/cloudstack-deb-builder:ubuntu1604

You can replace `ubuntu1604` tag by `ubuntu1804`, `ubuntu1404` or `latest` if you want.

### Build local repository

You can clone the CloudStack source code from repository locally on your machine and build packages against that.

#### Clone Apache CloudStack source code

The first step required is to clone the CloudStack source code somewhere on the filesystem, in `/tmp` for example:

    git clone https://github.com/apache/cloudstack.git /tmp/cloudstack

Now that you have done so we can continue.

#### Build packages of local repository

Now that we have cloned the CloudStack source code locally, we can build packages by mapping `/tmp` into `/mnt/build` in the container. (Note that the container always expects the `cloudstack` code exists in `/mnt/build` path.)

    docker run \
        -v /tmp:/mnt/build \
        khos2ow/cloudstack-deb-builder:ubuntu1604 [ARGS...]

Or if your local cloudstack folder has other name, you need to map it to `/mnt/build/cloudstack`.

    docker run \
        -v /tmp/cloudstack-custom-name:/mnt/build/cloudstack \
        khos2ow/cloudstack-deb-builder:ubuntu1604 [ARGS...]

After the build has finished the *.deb* packages are available in */tmp/cloudstack/dist/debbuild/DEBS* on the host system.

### Build remote repository

Also you can build DEB packages of any remote repository without the need to manually clone it first. You only need to specify git remote and git ref you intend to build from.

#### Build packages of remote repository

Now let's assume we want to build packages of `HEAD` of `master` branch from https://github.com/apache/cloudstack repository, we build packages by mapping `/tmp` into `/mnt/build` in the container. The container will clone the repository (defined by `--git-remote` flag) and check out the REF (defined by `--git-ref` flag) in `/mnt/build/cloudstack` inside the container and can be accessed from `/tmp/cloudstack` from the host machine.

    docker run \
        -v /tmp:/mnt/build \
        khos2ow/cloudstack-deb-builder:ubuntu1604 \
            --git-remote https://github.com/apache/cloudstack.git \
            --git-ref master \
            [ARGS...]

Note that any valid git Refspec is acceptable, such as:

- `refs/heads/<BRANCH>` to build specified Branch
- `<BRANCH>` short version of build specified Branch
- `refs/pull/<NUMBER>/head` to build specified GitHub Pull Request
- `refs/merge-requests/<NUMBER>/head` to build specified GitLab Merge Request
- `refs/tags/<NAME>` to build specified Tag

After the build has finished the *.deb* packages are available in */tmp/cloudstack/dist/debbuilds/DEBS* on the host system.

## Building tips

Check the following tips when using the builder:

### Maven cache

You can provide Maven cache folder (`~/.m2`) as a volume to the container to make it run faster.

    docker run \
        -v /tmp:/mnt/build \
        -v ~/.m2:/root/.m2 \
        khos2ow/cloudstack-deb-builder:ubuntu1604 [ARGS...]

### Adjust host owner permission

Builder container in some cases (e.g. using `--use-timestamp` flag) may change the file and directory owner shared from host to container (through volume) and it will create `dist` directory which holds the final artifacts. You can provide `USER_ID` (mandatory) and/or `USER_GID` (optional) from host to adjust the owner from whitin the container.

This is specially useful if you want to use this image in Jenkins job and want to clean up the workspace afterward. By adjusting the owner, you won't need to give your Jenkins' user `sudo` privilege to clean up.

    docker run \
        -v /tmp:/mnt/build \
        -e "USER_ID=$(id -u)" \
        -e "USER_GID=$(id -g)" \
        khos2ow/cloudstack-deb-builder:ubuntu1604 [ARGS...]

## Builder help

To see all the available options you can pass to `docker run ...` command:

    docker run \
        -v /tmp:/mnt/build \
        khos2ow/cloudstack-deb-builder:ubuntu1604 --help
